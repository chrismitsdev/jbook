## jBook

This is an interactive coding enviroment. You can write Javascript, see it executed, and write comprehensive documentation using markdown.

- Click any text cell to edit it.
- The code in each code editor is all joined together into one file. If you define a variable in cell #1, you can refer to it in any following cell!
- You can show any React component, string, number or anything else by calling the `show` function. This is a function built into this enviroment. Call `show` multiple times to show multiple values.
- Re-order or delete cells using the buttons on the top right.
- Add new cells by hovering on the divider between each cell.

All of your changes get saved to the file you opened jBook with. So if you run `npx jbook serve test.js`, all of the text and code you write will be saved to the `test.js` file.
